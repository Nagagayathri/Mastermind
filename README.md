# Mastermind
Mastermind is a game in which the computer asks the user to enter any word and checks if the user input word has anything common to the word generated by the computer which is unknown to the user. If it has, number of letters that are common gets printed on the console.Thus the user has to track all these outputs to reach out to the actual word. I have developed this game using Clojure functional programming language.
